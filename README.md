# Short Streams Practice Lab

Included in class Calculator are two methods than can use the Streams API to great effect.
* Rewrite method squareRoots() to take advantage of streams.
* Rewrite method squares() to also use the Streams API.

Included is a simple example of processing a list of names (as a String[]) using streams to print to the screen the first letter of each name.
* Run main() in class Calculator to see the output of the example.
